# Project Plan

## Summary

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 5 sentences. -->
This projects analyzes the relationship between the type and quantity of vehicles and the population and population composition in Münster.

## Rationale

<!-- Outline the impact of the analysis, e.g. which pains it solves. -->
The analysis can provide valuable insights into the current state of transportation infrastructure in the city, which can help local authorities make informed decisions on how to improve it. 

Additionally, understanding the relationship between the type and quantity of vehicles and the population and population composition can help identify potential areas of concern. For example, analyzing the types of vehicles preferred by Münster residents of different ages and genders can inform sales plans aimed at these groups. 

Lastly, this type of analysis can provide a better understanding of the transportation needs of different groups within the population, such as the elderly or young, which can inform policies aimed at improving their access to transportation services..
